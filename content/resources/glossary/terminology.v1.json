Perhaps this database helps a hospital track its patients, a school its students, or a bank its customers. Now imagine that the office that maintains this database needs to place it in long-term storage or disclose it to a third party without compromising the privacy of the people tracked. To eliminate the privacy risk, the office will anonymize the data, consistent with contemporary, ubiquitous data-handling practices. First, it will delete personal identifiers like names and social security numbers. Second, it will modify other categories of information that act like identifiers in the particular context—the hospital will delete the names of next of kin, the school will excise student ID numbers, and the bank will obscure account numbers. What will remain is a best-of-both-worlds compromise: Analysts will still find the data useful, but unscrupulous marketers and malevolent identity thieves will find it impossible to identify the people tracked. Anonymization will calm regulators and keep critics at bay. Society will be able to turn its collective attention to other problems because technology will have solved this one. Anonymization ensures privacy. Unfortunately, this rosy conclusion vastly overstates the power of anonymization. Clever adversaries can often reidentify or deanonymize the people hidden in an anonymized database. This Article is the first to comprehensively incorporate an important new subspecialty of computer science, reidentification science, into legal scholarship.

The archival bond first arises when a record is set aside and thereby connected to another in the course of action, but it is incremental, because, as the connective tissue that joins a record to those surrounding it, it is in continuing formation and growth until the aggregation in which the record belongs is no longer subject to expansion, that is, until the activity producing such aggregation is completed.

Beyond data curation, there are also issues surrounding discovery, file-format preservation and media longevity to consider, among others. ¶ Arkivum specialises in long-term data preservation -- currently serving mostly higher education and life sciences customers -- using an on-premises (physical or virtual) gateway appliance to copy encrypted data to tape libraries in its data centres. ¶ Storing and managing multiple copies of customers' data in geographically separate locations allows Arkivum to guarantee 100 percent data integrity irrespective of the data volume or retention period -- which can scale from terabytes to petabytes and range between 10 and 25 years respectively.

[Arts] – 10. The most common use refers to classes of performance that might synonymously be termed 'historically informed' or, 'historically aware, 'or employing 'period' or 'original' instruments and techniques. [Arts] – 11. So the claim of authenticity was based on identification of a photographer a time and place of exposure and a chain of transmission. [Arts] – 12. The term 'authenticity' can also be applied, as in the popular art world, to works that are proved to be genuine, demonstrated by the work of a particular composer. [Arts] – 13. An authentic performance is (at least) an accurate performance of a work. [Arts] – 14. The quality of being genuine or original. [Arts] – 15. The presence of the original is the prerequisite to the concept of authenticity. [Arts] – 16. The nature of the link between a composer and a work that bears his or her name. [A version of music is authentic] in terms the nature of the link between a composer and a work that bears his or her name. [A version of music is authentic] in terms of scoring, number of movements [and is] the authentic musical text with respect to pitches, rhythm, and the like as the composer wrote it. [Arts] – 17. Authenticity and genuineness of photographs examine the photograph as a physical object and a visual image. It is here that the diplomatic notion of authenticity is useful, because it requires that we analyze the photograph in terms of its physical composition, the correspondence between the image and reality it depicts, and the relationship between the image and its label in order to understand the functional context in which the photographic image is transformed into a photographic document. [Arts] – 18. The term ‘authenticity’ has been used in several senses relating to music. The most common use refers to classes of performance that might synonymously be termed ‘historically informed’ or ‘historically aware’, or employing ‘period’ or ‘original’ instruments and techniques. [Arts] – 19. Authenticity in transcription is a relation notion that operates within the gap between transcriptions that are barely recognizable as such and transcriptions that preserve the musical content of the original work as fully as is consistent with respecting the characteristics of the medium for which the transcriptions is written. [Arts] – 20. The authenticity of a photographic print should be based on certification by the photographer. Even if two prints were virtually (or even actually)indistinguishable, only the one certified by the photographer would count as genuine or authentic. [Arts] – 21.

First and foremost, an authentic record must have been created by the individual represented as the creator. The presence of a signature serves as a fundamental test for authenticity; the signature identifies the creator and establishes the relationship between the creator and the record. ¶ Authenticity can be verified by testing physical and formal characteristics of a record. The ink used to write a document must be contemporaneous with the document's purported date. The style and language of the document must be consistent with other, related documents that are accepted as authentic. ¶ Authenticity alone does not automatically imply that the content of a record is reliable. ¶ The authenticity of records and documents is usually presumed, rather than requiring affirmation. Federal rules of evidence stipulate that to be presumed authentic, records and documents must be created in the 'regular practice' of business and that there be no overt reason to suspect the trustworthiness of the record (Uniform Rules of Evidence, as approved July 1999).",

The authenticity of a record referred to its truth value as a physical manifestation of the facts it recorded (meaning its identity and its integrity), and it was assessed in relation to the document’s original instantiation. By the end of the nineteenth century, criteria for establishing reliability and authenticity were firmly ensconced in the common law of evidence and in historical criticism. In evidence law, they were made manifest in the circumstantial probability of trustworthiness granted to records created in the usual and ordinary course of business, in the ‘‘best evidence’’ rule governing the production of documentary originals and in the ‘‘ancient records’’ rule that presumed the authenticity of records maintained in a natural or proper place of custody over a substantial period of time. In historical criticism, they were reflected in the analytical techniques of external and internal criticism and in the preference for primary sources over secondary ones. (†251)"

As noted by the court in Lorraine : Whether ESI is admissible into evidence is determined by a collection of evidence rules that present themselves like a series of hurdles to be cleared by the proponent of the evidence. Failure to clear any of these evidentiary hurdles means that the evidence will not be admissible. Whenever ESI is offered as evidence, either at trial or in summary judgment, the following evidence rules must be considered: (1) is the ESI relevant as determined by Rule 401 (does it have any tendency to make some fact that is of consequence to the litigation more or less probable than it otherwise would be); (2) if relevant under 401, is it authentic as required by Rule 901(a) (can the proponent show that the ESI is what it purports to be); (3) if the ESI is offered for its substantive truth, is it hearsay as defined by Rule 801, and if so, is it covered by an applicable exception (Rules 803, 804 and 807); (4) is the form of the ESI that is being offered as evidence an original or duplicate under the original writing rule, or if not, is there admissible secondary evidence to prove the content of the ESI (Rules 1001-1008); and (5) is the probative value of the ESI substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or one of the other factors identified by Rule 403, such that it should be excluded despite its relevance. Litigants may find a number of these evidentiary hurdles particularly challenging when it comes to cloud data, especially authenticity and hearsay. The proponent of even an email, blog post, IM, tweet, or other communication that resides only in the cloud may need to secure declarations, deposition testimony, or even live testimony of the author(s), the recipient(s), the data custodian, and/or the cloud provider itself.

The justification for the rule can best be understood by considering the circumstances in which it arose. In the eighteenth century, copies of documents were typically prepared by hand; so the basis for the rule was the thought that if an original document was not examined, there was an increased possibility of fraud or mistake when relying upon the accuracy and veracity of a copy. However, with the development of a myriad of sophisticated electronic devices to accurately create, copy, and print documents, the rationale for the rule has been significantly eroded. As a result, the best evidence rule has evolved over time to reflect and incorporate the ever-present and changing effects of technology in our society. Even though today documents that are created, stored, and printed electronically are routinely admitted into evidence without undue expense or delay--provided there is no dispute regarding fairness or the document's authenticity--pitfalls still remain. In particular, given the myriad different forms that electronic information can come in, practitioners need to expand their concept beyond traditional documents and consider whether any information stored electronically is subject to the best evidence rule.

Whitman also realized that eBay, unlike many Internet businesses that were being created, simply “couldn’t be done off-line.” In other words, Whitman–a seasoned executive–saw a compelling, coherent narrative with the potential to be translated into a profitable business.

However, firms often depend on other actors in the market. So, to understand how a firm works, we must know the other important actors in its network. For this reason, we apply Alexander Osterwalder and his colleagues’ recent definition of a business model, which takes the entire firm’s network into consideration: \"[A business model is] a description of the value a company offers to one or several segments of customers and of the architecture of the firm and its network of partners for creating, marketing, and delivering this value and relationship capital, to generate profitable and sustainable revenue streams.\" Business models are often depicted as static descriptions of a firm’s activities in the market. However, markets aren’t static, and firms must respond to market changes. In addition, a change in a software firm’s products can change its business model. So, a business model that succeeds today might not be successful tomorrow, and firms must adjust their software offerings and business models to adapt to changing market conditions. (†1493)"

When a software vendor starts a firm, develops a new product, or expands a product line, it must evaluate how these changes impact the business model. In addition, in assessing a business model, the vendor should evaluate a new product’s or service’s added value to other actors and customers. (†1494)"

Bitcoin is subject to this problem because the integrity of the distributed ledger must be maintained in an environment where some of the miners may be actively working to subvert the ledger. This problem is called the Byzantine Generals’ Problem as it’s often described in terms of a group of generals of the Byzantine army camped with their troops around an enemy city. · The problem is often formulated along the following lines: ‘Reliable computer systems must handle malfunctioning components that give conflicting information to different parts of the system. This situation can be expressed abstractly in terms of a group of generals of the Byzantine army camped with their troops around an enemy city. Communicating only by messenger, the generals must agree upon a common battle plan. However, one or more of them may be traitors who will try to confuse the others. The problem is to find an algorithm to ensure that the loyal generals will reach agreement. It is shown that, using only oral messages, this problem is solvable if, and only if, more than two-thirds of the generals are loyal; so a single traitor can confound two loyal generals. With unforgeable written messages, the problem is solvable for any number of generals and possible traitors.

The requirement of authentication or identification is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims. At the threshold, the proponent must make a prima facie showing of authenticity sufficient to enable a reasonable juror to find in favor of authenticity.

When the evidence sought to be admitted may be distinguished only via scientific testing, then a chain of custody must be demonstrated to meet authentication requirements. If an article of evidence has no distinctive features or is fungible, authentication of the item must be proven by showing a chain of custody, typically from the scene of the crime to the courtroom. Accordingly, the proponent of a particular tangible item of evidence must establish its \"chain of custody,\" that is, must account for its handling from the time it was seized until it is offered into evidence. ¶The purpose of the chain-of-custody requirement is to ensure the reliability of the evidence to be tested. The law with respect to chain-of-custody issues requires proof sufficient to render it improbable that the original item has been exchanged, contaminated, or tampered with. A detailed chain of custody need be established only when the evidence offered is not readily identifiable or is susceptible to alteration and there is reason to believe that it may have been altered. Moreover, the chain of custody of an exhibit is irrelevant where the exhibit is positively identified at trial. (†764)"

Variations in the testimony regarding the chain of custody or deficiencies in the chain of custody affect only its weight, not its admissibility. . . . ¶In setting up a chain of evidence, the prosecution is not required to elicit testimony from every custodian or every person who had an opportunity to come in contact with the evidence sought to be admitted. The fact that one of the persons in control of a fungible substance does not testify at trial does not, without more, make the substance or testimony relating to it inadmissible. Further, the chain of custody rule does not require the prosecution to account for the possession of evidence before it comes into their hands. . . . ¶The state bears the burden of establishing the proper chain of custody. While the state is not required to eliminate every possibility of tampering with the evidence in order to establish a chain of custody, the trial court must be satisfied within a reasonable probability that there has been no tampering. Thus, even with respect to sub-stances that are not clearly identifiable or distinguishable, it is unnecessary to establish a perfect chain of custody or eliminate all possibility of tampering or misidentification, so long as there is persuasive evidence that the reasonable probability is that the evidence has not been altered in any material respect. The requirement of reasonable certainty is not met when some vital link in the chain of possession is not accounted for, because then it is as likely as not that the evidence analyzed was not the evidence originally received (†765)"

The ideal scenario in moving from one cloud service provider to another is a seamless service experience. By increasing service and application portability in a neutral and standardized cloud vendor ecosystem, portable deployment to any cloud becomes possible. ¶ The key to mitigating this risk of vendor lock-in is ensuring that your application is built on open standards and is portable to any cloud operating platform.

Cloud providers are sometimes referred to as cloud service providers or CSPs. ¶ There are a number of things to think about when you evaluate cloud providers. The cost will usually be based on a per-use utility model but there are a number of variations to consider. The physical location of the servers may also be a factor for sensitive data. ¶ Reliability is crucial if your data must be accessible. A typical cloud storage service-level agreement (SLA), for example, specifies precise levels of service – such as, for example, 99.9% uptime – and the recourse or compensation that the user is entitled to should the provider fail to provide the service as described. However, it’s important to understand the fine print in that agreement because some providers discount outages of less than ten minutes, which may be too long for some businesses. ¶ Security is another important consideration. Organizations such as the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) offer certification to cloud providers that meet their criteria. The CSA's Trusted Cloud Initiative program was created to help cloud service providers develop industry-recommended, secure and interoperable identity, access and compliance management configurations and practices. ¶ Amazon was the first major cloud provider, with the 2006 offering of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Other cloud providers include Apple, Cisco, Citrix, IBM, Joyent, Google, Microsoft, Rackspace, Salesforce.com and Verizon/Terremark. ¶ A telecom cloud provider is a telecommunications company that has shifted its focus to dedicate existing infrastructure to provide cloud services.

The concept of core competence is most closely associated with the work of Gary Hamel and C.K. Prahalad, notably in their book Competing for the Future (1994). They describe core competences as bundles of skills and technologies resulting from organizational learning. These provide access to markets, contribute to customer value, and are difficult for competitors to imitate. Core competence is a resource-based approach to corporate strategy. The terms core competence and core capability are often used interchangeably, but some writers make varying distinctions between the two concepts. (†1138)"

We turn to doctors, lawyers, counselors, teachers, bankers, accountants, and others for assistance in matters beyond our individual knowledge or capacities. [Note: This Note is concerned primarily with nonpersonal confidential relationships, rather than relationships of a personal nature with family or friends. . . . ] Relationships of this kind require us to lower our defenses and permit some intrusion into our personal lives. Specialists who advise us must have access to complete information for their advice to be effective. A person who lacks training in a specialty cannot separate relevant information from irrelevant, so all must be revealed. . . . ¶ To foster candor and cooperation within such relationships, those who advise or assist us ordinarily hold forth an assurance of secrecy. The source of this assurance is usually customary practice and common understanding, though professional codes of ethics or statutes n6 mandate confidentiality in certain relationships. Whether formalized or not, the assurance of secrecy is vital to the success of the relationship. We rely on it initially in forming the relationship, and thereafter in revealing what we would otherwise hold back. ¶ These two elements -- the assurance of secrecy and the reliance it evokes -- are the essential ingredients of what can be termed a \"confidential relationship.\" The giver of information places himself in a vulnerable position in reliance on the assurance of secrecy and thus has a legitimate expectation of confidentiality. The receiver of the information, by implicitly holding out the assurance associated with his occupation, invites the reliance and thus has an obligation not to disappoint the giver's expectation. Most would agree that revealing to a third party any private information learned within the relationship constitutes a moral wrong. (†783)"

          "text": "Vickery 1982 (†505 p. 1434-1435) : A disclosure to a third person in breach of confidence invades two distinct interests of the wronged individual: first, his general interest in the security of the confidential relationship and his corresponding expectation of secrecy; and second, his specific interest in avoiding whatever injuries will result from circulation of the information. The first interest is important because the expectation of secrecy prompts the communication of embarrassing information in the first place. If it is disappointed, the wronged party is likely to remain silent in circumstances that would otherwise call for frankness, in both the relationship violated and possibly in other confidential relationships essential to the person's welfare and prosperity. Even a limited disclosure of relatively innocuous information may destroy the individual's sense of security and deter future candor. ¶ The extent of invasion of the second interest depends on the content of the disclosure and the nature of the audience. The more intimate or embarrassing the information, the more damaging the disclosure probably will be. The wronged party may suffer ridicule, loss of business or professional reputation, or deterioration of personal relationships. Though injury often flows from widespread publication of disclosed information, the greatest injury may well be caused by disclosure to a single person, such as an employer or a spouse. ¶ The breach of confidential relationships also jeopardizes societal interests. Beyond a general interest in promoting justice between individuals when the conduct of one has injured another, society has specific interests in assuring that certain types of confidential relationships are respected. For example, the physical and mental health of individuals is a fundamental societal concern. Because confidentiality promotes the full disclosure necessary to effective medical treatment, society has an interest in fostering doctor patient confidences. Similarly, enforcement of lawyer-client confidences advances society's interest in having its members fully apprised of their legal rights and obligations. (†784)"

These wider environments include, but are in no way limited to, the functions of workgroups, organizations and nuclear and extended families; they also extend to the broad societal, legal, cultural and physical contexts in which individuals, families, partnerships, workgroups, communities and organizations operate. Nor is context confined to a moment or moments in time; behind every one of its aspects lies a complex web of prior events, occurrences, actions and situations, an evolving sequence of historical contexts for what we perceive as the contexts of the present day. As South African archivist Verne Harris has said, ‘there is no end to a search through this terrain’;61 context is infinite, and every context has contexts of its own. In practice, if archivists and archival institutions seek to document context, they have to decide what levels of context are most relevant to their needs or the needs of their users; this means making decisions about what to emphasize and what to ignore, decisions that will inevitably privilege some aspects of context above others.

The requirement to present a verifiable, singular identity makes it impossible to differ self-presentation strategies, creating tension as diverse groups of people flock to social network sites (Boyd, 2008). Privacy settings alone do not address this; even with private accounts that only certain people can read, participants must contend with groups of people they do not normally bring together, such as acquaintances, friends, co-workers, and family. To navigate these tensions, social network site users adopt a variety of tactics, such as using multiple accounts, pseudonyms, and nicknames, and creating ‘fakesters’ to obscure their real identities (Marwick, 2005). The large audiences for sites like Facebook or MySpace may create a lowest-common denominator effect, as individuals only post things they believe their broadest group of acquaintances will find non-offensive.

The territoriality principle is one of the basic jurisdictional principles, and states that any act committed in the physical territory of a jurisdiction will be tried under the laws of that jurisdiction (Ryngaert, 2008). The recent changes to the licensing rules stipulated in the Broadcasting (Class Licence) Notification (c. 28. 2013) in Singapore is an example of how countries still subscribe to the principle of territoriality, which conflicts with the borderless nature of the cloud.

Although this definition was used by the United Nations in 1982, well before the advent of cloud computing, it is still relevant in a cloud environment, as it conveys the continuous movement of data across national boundaries. In fact, Industry Canada’s Report on the Trilateral Committee on Transborder Data Flows (2010) highlighted that while the concept has not changed since the 1980s, “technological advances and ever-increasing efficiencies applied to existing technologies have expanded the scope of transborder data flows.” There are multiple juridical systems to be taken into consideration in a cloud computing environment: the legal system of the cloud service provider, the legal system of the cloud customer, the legal system of the place where the data centers storing the data/records are located, and the legal system of the individuals to which the data/records are related (McCullagh, 2012). This involvement of multiple juridical systems means that in case of litigation, it may be very difficult to establish the relevant jurisdiction because “nationality is not a quality attributable to data” but it is “an attribute to an individual person” (Poullet et al., 2010, p. 9). Claims of breaches in privacy, data protection, and copyright could be extremely difficult to resolve (Weber, 2013). (†1656)"

On the one hand, the Internet has given individuals a greater direct involvement in the transborder transfer of their personal data than ever before. On the other hand, regulation has become more complicated and less transparent, and thus less understandable for individuals. For example, many transborder data flows are conducted based on the consent of the individual, but there is growing concern that individuals may not understand what they are consenting to, and that they may not have a meaningful opportunity to refuse consent. The greater use of cloud computing technologies also means that it will become increasingly difficult for individuals to exercise their rights with regard to data stored in other countries. (†1657)"

There will always be cases where individuals become concerned about the processing of their personal data outside the borders of their country, based, for example, on a perceived risk of access to the data by foreign law enforcement, the chance of a breach of data security, or some other potential danger. Data controllers may also prefer to keep data within a particular region, and some cloud computing service providers already grant customers the option of keeping data within a national or regional ‘cloud’. Thus, the market for data processing services, driven by demand from both data controllers and individuals, will increasingly allow them to choose whether to restrict the transborder transfer of their personal data. Geography will also remain important with regard to law enforcement access to data, since more and more governments are likely to demand that entities offering communications in their countries also maintain communications equipment there, in order to facilitate such access.

It includes all data objects and types that have yet to be analyzed for any business or competitive intelligence or aid in business decision making. Typically, dark data is complex to analyze and stored in locations where analysis is difficult. The overall process can be costly. It also can include data objects that have not been seized by the enterprise or data that are external to the organization, such as data stored by partners or customers. ¶ IDC, a research firm, stated that up to 90 percent of big data is dark data.

It may use a combination of techniques, such as deleting, encrypting, or obfuscating specific data elements that are unique to and that could directly identify an individual, such as name, Social Security Number, or email address. Effective data anonymization is particularly challenging, as a group of seemingly unrelated elements can identify individuals indirectly. For example, birth date, sex, and ZIP code can identify many individuals, even in large data sets (Sweeney 2000). Unlike data obfuscation , data anonymization does not require that the resulting dataset has the same functionality as the original dataset. Some sources suggest that anonymization is distinguished from pseudonymization. Anonymization is limited to a specific dataset, making it impossible to link information about the individual to other datasets. Pseudonymization creates an artificial identifier for individuals that can be used to link information about the individuals in multiple datasets.",

While this has been the predominant method of data sanitization or obfuscation, it is important to realize that de-identified data may be subject to re-identification by utilizing categorical (i.e., demographic characteristics) or numerical data. Because of the risks associated with data being re-identified and the relatively small additional overhead of applying masking over de-identification alone, depending on the intended use of the data, often data masking is a superior option for non-production use or analysis of data at a non-aggregate level (i.e., analyzing individual records rather than sets of records).

These studies often report startling high success rates, and have caused some scholars to question the efficacy of de-identification entirely.10 For example, an often cited 2000 study found 87% of the U.S. population could be uniquely identified by their combination of gender, date of birth, and zip code. Even when new researchers replicated the study to reflect a growing population, they still found 63% of the population uniquely identifiable using these variables. Out of context, these numbers are startling. In reality, however, these unique and exact combinations of gender, date of birth, and zip code would never be present in a de-identified dataset. Such combinations are either generalized or removed entirely, drastically reducing the risk of re-identification. In the latter study above, researchers found the risk of unique identification dropped sharply when given slightly more abstract data. When they replaced an individual’s full date of birth with only the month and year, only 4.2% of the population remained uniquely identifiable, and when they also replaced zip code with county, just 0.2% remained uniquely identifiable. More impressively, data de-identified using the HIPAA safe harbor method is said to present only a .04% risk of unique identification. Still, the majority of re-identification studies continue to target data that is not truly de-identified, leading to what some call “the myth of easy re-identification.” While academics and scientists debate de-identification’s merits, however, a more pertinent question has been neglected: is sharing de-identified data legal?

Four criteria are central to a good definition: · Size and low cost: Data lakes are big. They can be an order of magnitude less expensive on a per-terabyte basis to set up and maintain than data warehouses. With Hadoop, petabyte-scale data volumes are neither expensive nor complicated to build and maintain. Some vendors that advocate the use of Hadoop claim that the cost per terabyte for data warehousing can be as much as $250,000, versus $2,500 per terabyte (or even less than $1,000 per terabyte) for a Hadoop cluster. Other vendors advocating traditional data warehousing and storage infrastructure dispute these claims and make a distinction between the cost of storing terabytes and the cost of writing or written terabytes. · Fidelity: Hadoop data lakes preserve data in its original form and capture changes to data and contextual semantics throughout the data lifecycle. This approach is especially useful for compliance and internal audit. If the data has undergone transformations, aggregations, and updates, most organizations typically struggle to piece data together when the need arises and have little hope of determining clear provenance. · Ease of accessibility: Accessibility is easy in the data lake, which is one benefit of preserving the data in its original form. Whether structured, unstructured, or semi-structured, data is loaded and stored as is to be transformed later. Customer, supplier, and operations data are consolidated with little or no effort from data owners, which eliminates internal political or technical barriers to increased data sharing. Neither detailed business requirements nor painstaking data modeling are prerequisites. · Late binding: Hadoop lends itself to flexible, task-oriented structuring and does not require up-front data models.

This principle implies that data stores, such as a company's financial system or customer database, can have the same critical value as a physical asset, such as a factory or a petroleum upgrader. Investing in maintaining data assets, through defined data management processes and data quality monitoring and improvements, then becomes an integral part of supporting the organization's core business objectives.

Some funding agencies require such a plan as part of a proposal. The plan addresses disposition, though with the default assumption that data produced in any research project that is brought to a successful conclusion should be kept for some time beyond the life of the project for possible reuse and repurposing, as well as to provide support for the conclusions reached in the research. Data management plans also address how the data will be maintained and what metadata will be kept with it. Given the rationale for the R&D project, I suggest that at least some consideration should be given to the option of producing records management plans that would be similar to data management plans, not only specifying the life expectancy for a given body of records but also setting out what should be done to ensure the records survive and are serviceable across that time. Such plans would be useful in articulating terms and conditions for cloud contracts. (†239)"

Data mining can be more fully characterized as the extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from data [Witten and Frank, 2000]. The information is implicit in the input data: it is hidden, unknown, and could hardly be extracted without recourse to automatic techniques of data mining. With text mining, however, the information to be extracted is clearly and explicitly stated in the text. It’s not hidden at all–most authors go to great pains to make sure that they express themselves clearly and unambiguously–and, from a human point of view, the only sense in which it is “previously unknown” is that human resource restrictions make it infeasible for people to read the text themselves. The problem, of course, is that the information is not couched in a manner that is amenable to automatic processing. Text mining strives to bring it out of the text in a form that is suitable for consumption by computers directly, with no need for a human intermediary. (†832)"

This means that the physical security measures associated with that location act as a significant part of the protection afforded to that data. ¶ Data in motion may operate through physically secured wiring and infrastructure. If the physical security is adequate to the need, no additional measures are required. However, the vast majority of information in motion today travels over long distances through insecure infrastructure. In these cases additional protection is required as the consequences increase. Protection of data in use is problematic because it must be in a form that is useful for processing. There are some cases, like comparison to specific known values in password verification, where data can be left encrypted and have utility. But the vast majority of uses require that the data be readable. ¶ Data in use is rarely protected against modification beyond process separation mechanisms, because this is not supported by current processors.

In essence, the data warehousing concept was intended to provide an architectural model for the flow of data from operational systems to decision support environments. The concept attempted to address the various problems associated with this flow, mainly the high costs associated with it. In the absence of a data warehousing architecture, an enormous amount of redundancy was required to support multiple decision support environments. In larger corporations, it was typical for multiple decision support environments to operate independently. Though each environment served different users, they often required much of the same stored data. The process of gathering, cleaning and integrating data from various sources, usually from long-term existing operational systems (usually referred to as legacy systems), was typically in part replicated for each environment. Moreover, the operational systems were frequently reexamined as new decision support requirements emerged. Often new requirements necessitated gathering, cleaning and integrating new data from \"data marts\" that were tailored for ready access by users. (†2610)"

Traditionally business continuity and disaster recovery (DR) planning have always been separated between the business and the information technology (IT) departments, but it has long been recognised that this \"divide\" creates more problems than it solves. After all, most businesses could not continue to operate successfully if their IT services were unavailable for a period of time. The recent launch of BS 25999 has established a Business Continuity Management (BCM) standard which intrinsically links BCM, Incident Management and IT DR. Essentially the key message is that to have true business continuity, you must also have strong IT DR capability. A disaster recovery plan should interface with the overall business continuity management plan. In the case of both, it's important to be clear and concise, to focus on the key activities required to recover the critical IT services, and to test, review and update on a regular basis. (†1542)"

We do this with cryptography via digital signatures, in much the same way we sign other digital documents, and digital fingerprints using a technique called ‘hashing’, which is extremely sensitive to any change in underlying data. The use of cryptography is what gave virtual currencies created on digital ledgers the name ‘cryptocurrencies’. · Two, we must determine what records are stored in the ledger and their precedence – the ledger’s contents.

Therefore, the enormity of the Holocaust cannot be forgotten and the forms in which it is given expression are important histor- ical phenomena in their own right. The dominant rhetoric of Primo Levi’s testimonial writing supports this argument. His phrase ‘the duty to remem- ber’ means that remembering the Holocaust is an ethico-political problem because it has to do with the construction of the future: ‘the duty to remem- ber consists not only in having a deep concern for the past but in transmit- ting the meaning of the past events to the next generation’ (Ricouer 1999: 9). The duty to remember is a duty to keep alive the memory of suffering by the persistent pursuit of an ethical response to the Holocaust experience. (†2686)"

It normally means the duty, the advice or the obligation, for the sake of human conscience, not to forget Nazism’s horrendous genocide which killed 6 million Jews in the Second World War. This crime was so enormous it went beyond what was considered human behavior to become completely inhuman. Humanity should never be allowed to forget this tragedy, this crime committed by man against man. The younger generation in Europe has been constantly reminded of this genocide by German Fascism. This tragedy, called Shoah or Holocaust, has been part of the curriculum at European schools so that students wouldn’t forget. ¶ Europeans convincingly say that they did so not because they simply “hate Hitler” or just to “remember the past”, but because they worry about the present and the future. They believe that if the younger generations are given complete information to realize how an insane and a murderous ideology has resulted in millions of innocent people being destroyed, there will be more chance of this tragedy not being repeated.

The rise of ESI has created several challenges for attorneys and clients involved in litigation. The first challenge is that there is now much more information to review and potentially produce as part of discovery. . . . ¶A second challenge is that ESI may be stored in myriad places. Electronic information can be stored not only on central servers and backup tapes, but also on each individual employee’s hard drive. Additionally, a client’s electronic information can be stored on individual laptops, BlackBerry devices, “smart” phones, or other PDAs (personal digital assistants). . . . ¶A third challenge is that ESI contains “hidden” data, or metadata. Metadata is “data about data,” and it may include, for example, information about who made what changes to a document and when the changes were made. This metadata is not seen when a document is printed, and therefore, producing an electronically stored document in paper form may omit some potentially responsive information. . . . ¶Amended Rule 34(a) adds a new category of discoverable information – electronically stored information – and includes within the definition of discoverable documents and ESI “writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, sound recordings, images, and other data or data compilations stored in any medium from which information can be obtained. . . .” (Emphasis added.) The definition that includes ESI is broader than the prior definition of “document” in Rule 34 and should encompass all electronically stored information. The definition of ESI is intentionally broad–it encompasses data stored in any medium–to cover new technologies that may develop. (†576)"

Like other unpermissioned blockchain platforms, the Ethereum blockchain is maintained by all connected nodes in the public network. Transaction verification and block creation is performed by validating nodes, also known as miners. Newly created blocks are then propagated to the network. · Ethereum serves as a flexible platform for anyone wishing to program blockchain applications on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).8 EVM can be thought of as a decentralised machine containinga number of different objects known as “accounts”, which are capable of executing code. There are two types of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and Contract Accounts. EOAs are accessed externally with private key verification, and Contract Accounts are governed by their internal codes. Smart contracts are computer codes added to transactions by users and sent to the ledger for deployment. Smart contract execution may be triggered by additional user-sent transactions. Sending a transaction to the account in EVM requires a small fee payment known as “gas”. The fee is a reward to the miners to compensate them for their costs in hardware and electricity in performing transaction validation and block creation. · The reward is paid in the Ethereum native cryptocurrency, ‘Ether’. It can be traded or used as a medium of payment on cryptocurrency exchanges, such as the Coinbase wallet system. Ether has been developed as a vehicle to facilitate the operation of peer-to-peer smart contracts. (†2058)"

Types of legal evidence include testimony, documentary evidence, and physical evidence. The parts of a legal case which are not in controversy are known, in general, as the \"facts of the case.\" Beyond any facts that are undisputed, a judge or jury is usually tasked with being a trier of fact for the other issues of a case. Evidence and rules are used to decide questions of fact that are disputed, some of which may be determined by the legal burden of proof relevant to the case. Evidence in certain cases (e.g. capital crimes) must be more compelling than in other situations (e.g. minor civil disputes), which drastically affects the quality and quantity of evidence necessary to decide a case. ¶ Scientific evidence consists of observations and experimental results that serve to support, refute, or modify a scientific hypothesis or theory, when collected and interpreted in accordance with the scientific method.

However, data by itself \"does not have any nationality but merely inherits the law of the territory in which it is located\" (Filippi & Mccarthy, 2012, p.8). Since data can be easily transmitted from one jurisdiction to another, the same bits of information can be subjected to several national laws within a specific moment in time. (†443)"

Indeed, due to these spatio-temporal shifts, the principle of territoriality, the traditional cornerstone of the law of jurisdiction, appears to be losing its salience in the field of international data protection. Where data are everywhere and become disconnected from physical territory, extraterritoriality may seem the only viable regulatory option. Unbounded extraterritoriality, however, has serious adverse consequences for both businesses and states. For businesses, regulatory burdens imposed by multiple states might increase transaction costs and legal uncertainty, while vigorous assertions of extraterritorial jurisdiction could cause international competency conflicts between different states, which might have different substantive views on the scope of data protection.

Extraterritoriality can also be applied to physical places, such as foreign embassies, military bases of foreign countries, or offices of the United Nations. The three most common cases recognized today internationally relate to the persons and belongings of foreign heads of state, the persons and belongings of ambassadors and other diplomats, and ships in foreign waters. Extraterritoriality is often extended to friendly or allied militaries, particularly for the purposes of allowing that military to simply pass through one's territory. It is distinguished from personal jurisdiction in the sense that extraterritoriality operates to the prejudice of local jurisdiction. (†444)"

Because the block data is different, this requires redoing the proof of work. Furthermore, the attacker's new version of block 270000 has a different hash, so the original blocks 270001 to 270005 do not \"point\" to it; thus, the original chain and the attacker's new chain are completely separate. The rule is that in a fork the longest blockchain is taken to be the truth, and so legitimate miners will work on the 270005 chain while the attacker alone is working on the 270000 chain. In order for the attacker to make his blockchain the longest, he would need to have more computational power than the rest of the network combined in order to catch up (hence, \"51% attack\").

This is most often used to create Altcoins - most of them are Forks of the Bitcoin repository, or other forked repositories. · Another type of Fork is a Blockchain Fork. It is an event in which there are multiple competing blocks of the same height. Those Forks may occur naturally due to multiple Miners creating a Block each at a similar time, or they can be malicious, for example - a result of a 51% Attack. · The last type of Fork is a Blockchain Fork caused by changes in the software operating the Blockchain (such as bitcoind). Those Forks may be incidental (such as the March 2013 Bitcoin fork), or deliberate (Ethereum's DAO fork). The latter are generally split into two kinds - Soft Forks and Hard Forks. · Soft Forks are less invasive and mainly require the Miners to upgrade their software. Old software will still recognize new blocks created after the Soft Fork as valid. An example of a Soft Fork could be the bugfix for Value Overflow Incident. · Hard Forks are more invasive and require everyone to upgrade their software. Old software will not recognize new blocks or transactions as valid after the Hard Fork. The Ethereum DAO Fork is perhaps the most famous example of a Hard Fork. · Contentious Hard Forks can sometimes lead to network splits, where a part of the network and community decide not to opt into the Forked code and Blockchain, and instead decide to take a different approach. Ethereum Classic is a network split that resulted from the DAO Fork. (†2100)"

Main properties (1) easy to compute the hash value for any given message (2) infeasible to generate a message from its hash (3) infeasible to modify a message without changing the hash (4) infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash. Cryptographic hash functions have many information security applications, notably in digital signatures, message authentication codes (MACs), and other forms of authentication. They can also be used as ordinary hash functions, to index data in hash tables, for fingerprinting, to detect duplicate data or uniquely identify files, and as checksums to detect accidental data corruption.

Once the blocks and the transaction data have been stored in a ledger, these blocks and data are immutable, i.e. cannot be altered. At the macro level, the consensus process among validating nodes ensures that no malicious validating nodes can inject falsified transactions into a DLT network. At the micro level, hash technology is applied to detect any alteration made to the original data. This is a mathematical unidirectional function that summarises a piece of data, regardless of its size, as a piece of unique fixed-size short data called its “hash value”. Any alteration to the data causes its hash value to change also. Hence, instead of having to inspect every piece of information in the lengthy data record in order to detect data alterations, one only needs to run the hash function on the data record to obtain a hash value. If the hash value has changed, then one can conclude that the data record has been altered. · The strength of the hash function is that it is close to impossible for anyone to determine a hash value in advance, and then to create a data record that will in turn produce the pre-determined hash value. A minor change in the original data record will result in major changes in the hash value. There are different hash algorithms in the technology world. A common example is SHA256, which reduces a data string of any size to a 256-bit number... (†2059)"

IA relates more to the business level and strategic risk management of information and related systems, rather than the creation and application of security controls.

Further, while information security draws primarily from computer science, IA is an interdisciplinary field requiring expertise in business, accounting, user experience, fraud examination, forensic science, management science, systems engineering, security engineering, and criminology, in addition to computer science.

This type of security is not a major concern in test and development databases. The data can be modified at will without any business impact. ¶ The second type of security is the protection of the information content from inappropriate visibility.

In order to guarantee a true alignment between ICT and business, increasing attention should be paid to \"ICT governance\" (Broadbent & Weill, 2003; Robinson, 2007; Symons, 2004). There are several contributions in the literature which address ICT governance issues from varying perspectives. In this article, ICT governance is defined as how ICT decisions are made within a company. This definition requires all those company members involved in ICT-related decision-making processes (i.e., the Chief Executive Officer [CEO], all the C-levels, the CIO, the ICT suppliers, the ICT users) to be included when analyzing ICT governance (Rau, 2004; Xue, Liang, & Boulton, 2008). The ultimate goal of ICT governance is to guarantee that ICT support the achievement of company business goals through value-added contributions that balance risks and returns (Bowen, Cheung, & Rohde, 2007; Peterson, 2004).

To address this gap, a virtualization hypervisor mediates access between guest operating systems and the physical compute resources. Still, even hypervisors have exhibited flaws that have enabled guest operating systems to gain inappropriate levels of control or influence on the underlying platform. A defense in depth strategy is recommended, and should include compute, storage, and network security enforcement and monitoring.

A vendor’s willingness to assume this risk will likely be dependent on a number of factors including whether the customer is using a public or private cloud, the type of services purchased by the customer, i.e., Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), pricing and any limitations of liability set forth in the underlying agreement. IaaS is considered to embody less risk to the customer than SaaS as the customer retains less control with SaaS. Similarly, a public cloud is considered to be inherently more risky than a private cloud given the nature of a shared environment. (†1380)"

Some electronic records that merit long-term preservation may still be at risk. ¶ Stage 5. Optimal Digital Preservation Capability. The highest level of digital preservation readiness capability that an organization can achieve. It includes a strategic focus on digital preservation outcomes by continuously improving the manner in which electronic records lifecycle management is executed. Few, if any, electronic records that merit long-term preservation are at risk. (†1468)"

CMM for software, from the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), is a model used by many enterprises to identify best practices useful in helping them assess and increase the maturity of their software development processes. Scope Notes: CMM ranks software development enterprises according to a hierarchy of five process maturity levels. Each level ranks the development environment according to its capability of producing quality software. A set of standards is associated with each of the five levels. The standards for level one describe the most immature or chaotic processes and the standards for level five describe the most mature or quality processes.A maturity model that indicates the degree of reliability or dependency the business can place on a process achieving the desired goals or objectives.A collection of instructions that an enterprise can follow to gain better control over its software development process.

For example, deleting data has been a concern in distributed systems for a while now, to which monitoring, marking and tracking mechanisms have been employed for data discovery. Data sanitization is an important task in order to properly dispose of data and physical resources that are sent to the garbage. For instance, Google has destruction policies to physically wreck hard drives. However, deficient implementation of data destruction policies at the end of a lifecycle, may result in data loss and data disclosure, because hard disks might be discarded without being completely wiped or might not be wrecked at all because other tenants might still be using them. Hence, one can say media sanitization is hard or impossible due to resource pooling and elasticity in cloud environments. Since pooling and elasticity entail that resources allocated to one user will be reallocated to a different user at a later time, it might be possible for subsequent tenants to read data previously written. In fact, the media recently reported a case related with sanitization. Basically, cloud recycling, as it was termed, consists in reusing a cloud instance previously used by another customer. What was strange in the case was that of the instance being exposed to massive amounts of network traffic right after being lit up. It should have been zero. After the new customer investigated, it was found that an Internet Protocol (IP) address was maybe cached and that it belonged to an ad company that perhaps did not realized that IP was still part of their live infrastructure. The instance was nonetheless returned by the new customer. This case describes an innocent oversight that could render all cloud safeguards irrelevant if a bad actor happened to gain access to that instance. Pearson said there is a higher risk to customers when reusing hardware resources than dedicated hardware. (†1640)"

For example, any protection that the computer’s operating system offers is lost when someone removes the hard drive from the computer and installs it in a second system that can read the on-disk formats, but doesn’t honor the access control lists. This vulnerability of confidential information left on information systems has been recognized since the 1960s. Legal protections that assure data confidentiality are similarly void. In California v. Greenwood, the US Supreme Court ruled that there is no right to privacy in discarded materials. Likewise, it is unlikely that an individual or corporation could claim that either has a privacy or trade secret interest in systems that they themselves have sold. Experience has shown that people routinely scavenge electronic components from the waste stream and reuse them without the original owner’s knowledge. Thus, to protect their privacy, individuals and organizations must remove confidential information from disk drives before they repurpose, retire, or dispose of them as intact units—that is, they must sanitize their drives. The most common techniques for properly sanitizing hard drives include [1)]Physically destroying the drive, rendering it unusable, [2)] Degaussing the drive to randomize the magnetic domains—most likely rendering the drive unusable in the process, [and 3)] Overwriting the drive’s data so that it cannot be recovered. Sanitizing is complicated by social norms. Clearly, the best way to assure that a drive’s information is protected is to physically destroy the drive. But many people feel moral indignation when IT equipment is discarded and destroyed rather than redirected toward schools, community organizations, religious groups, or lesser-developed nations where others might benefit from using the equipment—even if the equipment is a few years obsolete.

Notes: Metadata is commonly defined as \"data about data.\" Metadata is frequently used to locate or manage information resources by abstracting or classifying those resources or by capturing information not inherent in the resource. Typically metadata is organized into distinct categories and relies on conventions to establish the values for each category. For example, administrative metadata may include the date and source of acquisition, disposal date, and disposal method. Descriptive metadata may include information about the content and form of the materials. Preservation metadata may record activities to protect or extend the life of the resource, such as reformatting. Structural metadata may indicate the interrelationships between discrete information resources, such as page numbers. In terms of archives, MARC format and EAD are standards for structuring descriptive metadata about collections. Dublin Core is a standard for structuring metadata that is intended for describing web resources. In terms of information technology, metadata includes the documentation of data architecture, properties, and methods necessary to store, retrieve, and use the data in a meaningful manner. To the extent that data is a record, it may also include administrative, descriptive, preservation, and structural information.",

A \"share\" is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid proof of work that their miner solved. Mining in pools began when the difficulty for mining increased to the point where it could take years for slower miners to generate a block. The solution to this problem was for miners to pool their resources so they could generate blocks more quickly and therefore receive a portion of the block reward on a consistent basis, rather than randomly once every few years.

The rest of the fields may not be changed, as they have a defined meaning. · Any change to the block data (such as the nonce) will make the block hash completely different. Since it is believed infeasible to predict which combination of bits will result in the right hash, many different nonce values are tried, and the hash is recomputed for each value until a hash containing the required number of zero bits is found. The number of zero bits required is set by the difficulty.

But as we stand at the cusp of this open data-driven transformation, we should also take a deep breath and consider how “openness” is being used to drive public sector change. ¶ ...One of the problems with the way “openness” is treated in the Gov 2.0 agenda is that it’s never quite clear whether “open” is a means or an end. ¶ If it’s a means to an end – for example, the interoperability and therefore resilience of software systems – then clearly this is not the same openness as government transparency, and will have little effect on the process of reducing government secrecy or corruption. ¶ An “openness” that lets digital entrepreneurs manage the design and delivery of government services may improve usability, but it’s also a radical revisioning of the role of the public sector – a shift towards what Irish tech guru Tim O’Reilly coined “Government as Platform”, or what others might simply call “privatisation”. ¶ If the “open government” agenda has more ambitious goals like government transparency and democratic participation, then this will require more than a healthy digital ecosystem. Opening up data alone does not necessarily equate to citizen engagement, appified or otherwise. (†343)"

Although we may think mostly about government and public sector bodies releasing public information such as budgets or maps, or researchers sharing their results data and publications, any organisation can open information (corporations, universities, NGOs, startups, charities, community groups and individuals). . . . ¶ There are 2 important elements to openness: · Legal openness: you must be allowed to get the data legally, to build on it, and to share it. Legal openness is usually provided by applying an appropriate (open) license which allows for free access to and reuse of the data, or by placing data into the public domain. · Technical openness: there should be no technical barriers to using that data. For example, providing data as printouts on paper (or as tables in PDF documents) makes the information extremely difficult to work with.

Access The work shall be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet without charge. The work must also be available in a convenient and modifiable form. Comment: This can be summarized as ‘social’ openness – not only are you allowed to get the work but you can get it. ‘As a whole’ prevents the limitation of access by indirect means, for example by only allowing access to a few items of a database at a time (material should be available in bulk as necessary). Convenient and modifiable means that material should be machine readable (rather than, for example, just human readable). 2. Redistribution The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the work either on its own or as part of a package made from works from many different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale or distribution. 3. Reuse The license must allow for modifications and derivative works and must allow them to be distributed under the terms of the original work. Comment: Note that this clause does not prevent the use of ‘viral’ or share-alike licenses that require redistribution of modifications under the same terms as the original. 4. Absence of Technological Restriction The work must be provided in such a form that there are no technological obstacles to the performance of the above activities. This can be achieved by the provision of the work in an open data format, i.e. one whose specification is publicly and freely available and which places no restrictions monetary or otherwise upon its use. 5. Attribution The license may require as a condition for redistribution and re-use the attribution of the contributors and creators to the work. If this condition is imposed it must not be onerous. For example if attribution is required a list of those requiring attribution should accompany the work. 6. Integrity The license may require as a condition for the work being distributed in modified form that the resulting work carry a different name or version number from the original work. 7. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons. Comment: In order to get the maximum benefit from the process, the maximum diversity of persons and groups should be equally eligible to contribute to open knowledge. Therefore we forbid any open-knowledge license from locking anybody out of the process. Comment: this is taken directly from item 5 of the OSD. 8. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the work in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the work from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research. Comment: The major intention of this clause is to prohibit license traps that prevent open material from being used commercially. We want commercial users to join our community, not feel excluded from it. Comment: this is taken directly from item 6 of the OSD. 9. Distribution of License The rights attached to the work must apply to all to whom it is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties. Comment: This clause is intended to forbid closing up knowledge by indirect means such as requiring a non-disclosure agreement. Comment: this is taken directly from item 7 of the OSD. 10. License Must Not Be Specific to a Package The rights attached to the work must not depend on the work being part of a particular package. If the work is extracted from that package and used or distributed within the terms of the work’s license, all parties to whom the work is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original package. Comment: this is taken directly from item 8 of the OSD. 11. License Must Not Restrict the Distribution of Other Works The license must not place restrictions on other works that are distributed along with the licensed work. For example, the license must not insist that all other works distributed on the same medium are open. Comment: Distributors of open knowledge have the right to make their own choices. Note that ‘share-alike’ licenses are conformant since those provisions only apply if the whole forms a single work. Comment: this is taken directly from item 9 of the OSD. (†332)"

Thus, the discussion about the basis of an effective realization and implementation of Open Government is seen in the discussion about Open Data. ¶ In addition to the narrow understanding of Open Government (transparency, participation and collaboration) there is also a wider definition of Open Government and its impact to govern: The so-called “family of open government” consists of more than Open Data, Transparency, Participation and Collaboration. Further dimensions within the discussion about Open Government are the debates about Open Access and Open Knowledge as well as Open Innovation and Open Societal Innovation. Furthermore, Open Process Chains and Open Value Added Economic Chains can be discussed practically besides Open Statecraft and the Open Policy-Cycle theoretically.

Open government promotes transparency and engagement to allow effective oversight. This myth suggests that full, immediate, and widespread disclosure of public data results in an accountable and transparent government (see for example European Commission, 2010). However, at least two main assumptions challenge this myth. The first is that one is able to find the right data and is able to interpret and process the data in a uniform way, whereas the reality is that finding the right data might be difficult, there might be a huge information overload, and large differences in the way open-data analysts and how an individual might analyze the same data may draw different conclusions. Furthermore, open-data sources might not be consistent and may depict to different directions. Second, system theory provides the need for introducing feedback mechanisms to close the loop between the government and those governed. Although there are anecdotal examples, the wider impact is unclear. It is easier to not publish data than to introduce mechanisms to seek feedback and discourse in a climate of decreasing budgets. Creating an open government demands considerable transformations of the public sector. The paradox is that more information does not necessarily result in better, or more democratic, or more rational decisions. More information can result in less understanding, more confusion, and less trust (Strathern, 2000). Experience and tacit knowledge might be lacking among those who should be able to make sense of the open data. Our interviews indicate that transparency might result in better accountability, transparency, and trust, but sometimes has the opposite effect. For example, publicizing data can show that the quality of the data on which important decisions are made is poor. By providing the minutes of city council meetings, people might be shocked about the discussion and lose trust in the decision-making process and the resulting decisions. (†336)"

Publish Government Information Online: To increase accountability, promote informed participation by the public, and create economic opportunity, each agency shall take prompt steps to expand access to information by making it available online in open formats. With respect to information, the presumption shall be in favor of openness (to the extent permitted by law and subject to valid privacy, confidentiality, security, or other restrictions). . . . ¶ 2. Improve the Quality of Government Information: To improve the quality of government information available to the public, senior leaders should make certain that the information conforms to OMB guidance on information quality3 and that adequate systems and processes are in place within the agencies to promote such conformity. . . . ¶ 3. Create and Institutionalize a Culture of Open Government: To create an unprecedented and sustained level of openness and accountability in every agency, senior leaders should strive to incorporate the values of transparency, participation, and collaboration into the ongoing work of their agency. Achieving a more open government will require the various professional disciplines within the Government – such as policy, legal, procurement, finance, and technology operations – to work together to define and to develop open government solutions. Integration of various disciplines facilitates organization-wide and lasting change in the way that Government works. . . . ¶ 4. Create an Enabling Policy Framework for Open Government: Emerging technologies open new forms of communication between a government and the people. It is important that policies evolve to realize the potential of technology for open government. (†801)"

Transparency isn’t just about access, it is also about sharing and reuse – often, to understand material it needs to be analyzed and visualized and this requires that the material be open so that it can be freely used and reused. ¶ 2. Releasing social and commercial value. In a digital age, data is a key resource for social and commercial activities. Everything from finding your local post office to building a search engine requires access to data, much of which is created or held by government. By opening up data, government can help drive the creation of innovative business and services that deliver social and commercial value. ¶ 3. Participatory Governance. Much of the time citizens are only able to engage with their own governance sporadically – maybe just at an election every 4 or 5 years. By opening up data, citizens are enabled to be much more directly informed and involved in decision-making.

Public data is data that is not subject to valid privacy, security or privilege limitations. ¶ While non-electronic information resources, such as physical artifacts, are not subject to the Open Government Data principles, it is always encouraged that such resources be made available electronically to the extent feasible. 2. Primary Data is as collected at the source, with the highest possible level of granularity, not in aggregate or modified forms. ¶ If an entity chooses to transform data by aggregation or transcoding for use on an Internet site built for end users, it still has an obligation to make the full-resolution information available in bulk for others to build their own sites with and to preserve the data for posterity. 3. Timely Data is made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data. 4. Accessible Data is available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes. ¶ Data must be made available on the Internet so as to accommodate the widest practical range of users and uses. This means considering how choices in data preparation and publication affect access to the disabled and how it may impact users of a variety of software and hardware platforms. Data must be published with current industry standard protocols and formats, as well as alternative protocols and formats when industry standards impose burdens on wide reuse of the data. ¶ Data is not accessible if it can be retrieved only through navigating web forms, or if automated tools are not permitted to access it because of a robots.txt file, other policy, or technological restrictions. 5. Machine processable Data is reasonably structured to allow automated processing. ¶ The ability for data to be widely used requires that the data be properly encoded. Free-form text is not a substitute for tabular and normalized records. Images of text are not a substitute for the text itself. Sufficient documentation on the data format and meanings of normalized data items must be available to users of the data. 6. Non-discriminatory Data is available to anyone, with no requirement of registration. ¶ Anonymous access to the data must be allowed for public data, including access through anonymous proxies. Data should not be hidden behind “walled gardens.” Non-proprietary Data is available in a format over which no entity has exclusive control. ¶ Proprietary formats add unnecessary restrictions over who can use the data, how it can be used and shared, and whether the data will be usable in the future. While some proprietary formats are nearly ubiquitous, it is nevertheless not acceptable to use only proprietary formats. Likewise, the relevant non-proprietary formats may not reach a wide audience. In these cases, it may be necessary to make the data available in multiple formats. License-free Data is not subject to any copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret regulation. Reasonable privacy, security and privilege restrictions may be allowed. ¶ Because government information is a mix of public records, personal information, copyrighted work, and other non-open data, it is important to be clear about what data is available and what licensing, terms of service, and legal restrictions apply. Data for which no restrictions apply should be marked clearly as being in the public domain. ¶ Compliance must be reviewable. (†851)"

The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and at the state level freedom of information laws (FOIL) are laws that grant the public access to these sorts of government records. Each FOIA/FOIL request is for a particular record. FOIA/FOIL create a direct relationship between the government and the information consumer. …¶ Open government data is the type of disclosure suited for mediators, whether they be journalists, programmers, statisticians, or designers, who transform the originally disclosed bytes into something very different and of a greater value to a consumer. And so it is ironic that open government data faces resistance in government because open government data is not the future of e-government innovation: it is a new technological approach to the sort of information dissemination that has always existed. The best argument for open government data that I’ve heard is that this is how consumers already get their information, although they don’t see it in those terms. Whether you are a politician who wants to shape the debate or an administrator who wants to reduce the cost of processing FOIA requests, you have to show up to the party to have the chance to participate, and that party has always been the information mediators. As Derek Willis of The New York Times put it to me, it’s as simple as this: people go to Google to find information, so governments ought to make sure their information is findable on Google if anyone is going to see it. That means more than making sure your website is indexed. It means working with all of the “engines of information,” as Willis put it. The presumption of openness established by FOIA/FOIL is still important for open government, of course, but FOIA/FOIL stop short of guiding how government data can be disclosed in a way that promotes this sort of mediation.\" (†344)"

But perhaps the open government data movement cannot be decomposed according to its words. Justin Grimes has pointed out to me that, looking at its history, the movement has come out of three very distinct communities: classic open government advocates whose focus has typically been on freedom of information and money in politics, open source software and open scholarly data advocates, and open innovation entrepreneurs (who might include both Gov 2.0 entrepreneurs and government staff looking to the public for expertise, such as in Peer to Patent).

Data must be machine-processable following the general guiding principle of making choices that promote analysis and reuse. Properly implemented open government data also has these desired qualities: “Open” or “Accessible”: Data should use non-proprietary file formats appropriate for the intended use of the data, be documented, be posted permanently, and use safe file formats. “Accurate” and other aspects of data quality: Governments should provide the lowest-level granular data and should make data interoperable through coordination. Data should also maximize accuracy and precision at a reasonable cost to the data user. “Authentic” and questions of process: This category of principles addresses how a data release should address human needs such as relevance and trust.

It’s an idea known as Linus’s Law. “If many eyes had been looking at bash over the past 25 years, these bugs would’ve been found a long time ago,” Graham wrote on his blog last week. ¶ Linus Torvalds–the guy that Linus’s Law is named after and the guy who created the Linux operating system–says that the idea still stands. But the fallacy is the idea that all open-source projects have many eyes. “[T]here’s a lot of code that doesn’t actually get very many eyes at all,” he says. “And a lot of open-source projects don’t actually have all that many developers involved, even when they are fairly core.” (†865)"

Laws: Laws and regulations define the legally mandated duties to protect associated with jurisdictions. All laws of all jurisdictions in which an enterprise operates have to be considered in order to make prudent determinations about duty to protect.

Owners of privately held firms are directly responsible for the disposition of their assets and for proper protection and they directly suffer from poor decisions in this regard. Board: The board of directors is legally and morally responsible to assure that the CEO and other officers are doing their jobs and have the ability to define additional duties to protect in keeping with their responsibilities.

Auditors: Auditors are tasked with providing independent and objective feedback to the shareholders, board of directors, CEO, and others on the effectiveness of the protection program in fulfilling the duties to protect within the risk tolerance parameters set by management. CEO: The CEO is responsible for day-to-day control over the enterprise, and as part and parcel of this responsibility, for protecting shareholder value, for identifying the duties to protect, or assuring that those duties are carried out, for measuring the performance of those duties to allow adequate control to improve situations that warrant improvement and for keeping costs as low as possible without undertaking inappropriate levels of risk. In concert, these elements comprise the oversight functions of enterprise information protection and define the duty to protect. (†1489)"

Some examples of information that could identify an individual include, but are not limited to, name, passport number, social security number, or biometric data. In contrast, a list containing only credit scores without any additional information concerning the individuals to whom they relate does not provide sufficient information to distinguish a specific individual. ¶ To trace an individual is to process sufficient information to make a determination about a specific aspect of an individual's activities or status. For example, an audit log containing records of user actions could be used to trace an individual's activities. ¶ Linked information is information about or related to an individual that is logically associated with other information about the individual.

Bearman’s proposal was for archivists to leave the electronic records with the creators as they could be easily copied and made accessible on disc, and to limit their responsibilities to keeping paper records and to providing creators with directions for preservation and dissemination of electronic records, monitoring the way in which they carried out such activities. . . . ¶ This trend, which came to be called “postcustodialism,” found much support in Australia and some in the Netherlands, but generally was not accepted by the international archival community, and appeared to have been definitely buried in 1998 by the renaming of the Australia Commonwealth Archives Office “National Archives of Australia” and the attribution to it of the primary mandate of preserving the “national archival collection.” However, fifteen years later, albeit by another name, the idea of postcustodialism is again raising its ugly head, but this time it is not concerning only electronic records created by government agencies, but all records, born digital and digitised, be they indivisible archival aggregations or isolated documents only virtually connected, public or private, old or new, open to access or not, destined to be kept forever or for a nano second.

This nuance seems to have originated in the mid-20th century, in formations such as post-national (1945) and post-racial (1971). ¶ Post-truth seems to have been first used in this meaning in a 1992 essay by the late Serbian-American playwright Steve Tesich in The Nation magazine. Reflecting on the Iran-Contra scandal and the Persian Gulf War, Tesich lamented that ‘we, as a free people, have freely decided that we want to live in some post-truth world’. There is evidence of the phrase ‘post-truth’ being used before Tesich’s article, but apparently with the transparent meaning ‘after the truth was known’, and not with the new implication that truth itself has become irrelevant.

Effectively, it has defined the universe of discourse for digital preservation in a variety of contexts around the world. As a reference model, OAIS neither specifies a design or an implementation nor prescribes or even recommends any specific technology for preservation. The standard recognizes that implementations might organize functionality differently. PaaST requirements supplement OAIS in that they are intended to be directly implementable in software. Nonetheless, like OAIS, PaaST does not specify what technology should be used. Rather, it defines what the technology must be able to do. (†2421)"

The dependency depicts the derivation relationship between the application datasets. In cloud workflow systems, after the execution of tasks, some intermediate datasets may be deleted to save the storage cost, but sometimes they have to be regenerated for either reuse or reanalysis (Bose & Frew, 2005). Data provenance records the information of how the datasets have been generated. Furthermore, regeneration of the intermediate datasets from the input data may be very time consuming, and therefore carry a high computation cost. With data provenance information, the regeneration of the demanding dataset may start from some stored intermediated datasets instead. In a cloud workflow system, data provenance is recorded during workflow execution. Taking advantage of data provenance, we can build an Intermediate data Dependency Graph (IDG) based on data provenance (Yuan et al., 2010). (†1209)"

With thin provisioning, IT can keep storage growth in check because it need not commit physical disk space for the projected amount of storage an application requires.

For instance, being lax about monitoring the amount of space users and applications are absorbing can lead to overspending on hardware and software, and necessitate an increase in system management.

Most experts say that a key attribute of the cloud is that the dynamic provisioning is self-service - that is, at the user's demand. But the controlled environment of the mainframe, which is the basis for much of its security, traditionally requires an administrator to provision computing power for specific tasks.

WP136 describes pseudonymization as ‘the process of disguising identities’, to enable collection of additional information on the same individual without having to know his identity, particularly in research and statistics. There are two types: *Retraceable/reversible pseudonymization aims to allow ‘retracing’ or re-identification in restricted circumstances. For example, ‘key-coded data’ involves changing names to code numbers, with a ‘key’ mapping numbers to names. This is common in pharmaceutical trials. Another example is applying two-way cryptography to direct identifiers. *Irreversible pseudonymization is intended to render re-identification impossible, for example ‘hashing’, applying one-way cryptography (hash functions) to direct identifiers. Retraceably pseudonymized data may be ‘personal data’, as the purpose is to enable re-identification, albeit in limited circumstances. If each code is unique to an individual, identification is still a risk, so pseudonymized information remains ‘personal data’. However, if pseudonymization reduces the risks for individuals, data protection rules could be applied more flexibly, and the processing of pseudonymized data subjected to less strict conditions, than the processing of information regarding directly identifiable individuals.

As a substitute for centralized or quasi-centralized trust, public blockchains are secured by cryptoeconomics – the combination of economic incentives and cryptographic verification using mechanisms such as proof of work or proof of stake, following a general principle that the degree to which someone can have an influence in the consensus process is proportional to the quantity of economic resources that they can bring to bear.

In particular, the legal definition of record may change, depending on relevant laws, rules, and regulations. [In the United States,] the general legal definition of public records is established in the Federal Records Act (44 USC 3301), but 'record' is defined for different purposes in the Privacy Act (5 USC 552(a)). See also business record, which is defined in the Rules of Federal Evidence ( SAA Glossary 2005 ). Some archivists and records managers make a clear distinction between records and documents, while others do not. For some, 'record' is narrow category, and might include the official (record) copy, a copy filed for public notice, or the final, complete version, while 'document' is a separate category that might include copies, drafts, and items not part of business activities. In a legal context, all documents are discoverable, but only those records that fall within the hearsay exception ('business records') may be admitted as evidence at trial.",

A record is public if, by law or regulation, it is filed in a public office and required to be kept there. Also, if a written record of the transactions of a public officer in his or her office is a convenient and appropriate mode of discharging the duties of the office, it is not only the officer's right but also his or her duty to keep that memorial whether expressly required to do so or not; when kept, it is a public document n5 that belongs to the office rather than to the officer. n6 Thus, a record is public if it is kept pursuant to the official duties of a particular officer even if it is not specifically mandated by a statute. However, the determination as to what records must be maintained by a public officer is the prerogative of the legislature. A record may be public for one purpose but not for another, and whether it is a public record depends upon the purposes of the law to be served by so classifying it. Observation: The purpose of a public records law is to expose government activity to public scrutiny, which is absolutely essential to the proper working of a democracy. Inherent in such law is the public's right to monitor the conduct of government. (†1035)"

Recently, however, computer scientists have revealed that this \"anonymized\" data can easily be re-identified, such that the sensitive information may be linked back to an individual. The re-identification process implicates privacy rights, because organizations will say that privacy obligations do not apply to information that is anonymized, but if the data is in fact personally identifiable, then privacy obligations should apply.

Reidentification science is a new field in computer science research that reattaches anonymized information to identified individuals. Researchers may reidentify a dataset by, for example, comparing two databases, one anonymized and one containing PII [Personally Identifiable Information] and some information fields in common with the anonymized database. The FTC has recently acknowledged that the distinction between PII and de-identified information is often blurred. Because of the ease with which data can be reidentified, Ohm suggests rejecting the concept of PII entirely, though Schwartz and Solove instead suggest a reunderstanding of what information should be considered PII. Considering the technological issues, theorists who urge government regulation should evaluate which approach to PII should be taken. Reidentification science should be examined by policymakers to determine whether the concept of PII should be expanded to include both identified and identifiable information. Schwartz and Solove propose a model in which information is considered identified when the person's identity is ascertained, identifiable when there is a nonremote possibility of future identification, and nonidentifiable when the risk of identification is remote and the information is not relatable to a person.

Until very recently, most regulators have accepted this argument as well in granting safe harbors or similar exceptions to data privacy regulations for data that has been anonymized. In the outsourcing and cloud-computing industry, customers have followed suit in routinely granting their service providers the right to use customer data so long as the service providers aggregate it with other data and remove personally identifiable data prior to disclosing it. In recent years, computer scientists have demonstrated that anonymized data can be “reidentified” by linking anonymized records to outside information. ... In each case, researchers found that seemingly anonymous data contained unique attributes and other clues that enabled them to reidentify it with individuals. Once a person has been identified, the effect is compounded as it becomes easier to associate more and more information with that person. The ease with which researchers can reidentify anonymized data has several implications in the outsourcing and cloud-based service industry. Among them: • Regulations generally define the “personal data” that they cover broadly as information that can be used to identify a person. With reidentification, seemingly innocuous information such as search queries and Netflix reviews could arguably fall within the definition of personal data and be subject to additional regulation. • Regulators are beginning to explicitly address new types of data ( e.g., IP addresses, cookie identifiers). • Reidentification also may lead to increased liability. For example, if personal information collected by a company is disclosed by the company’s service provider and later reidentified, the company may face claims from its end users and possibly fines from regulators; the service provider may face claims from the company for failing to adequately anonymize the data.

A record is considered reliable when it can be treated as a fact in itself, that is, as the entity of which it is evidence.

The debate would sound quite different if the slogan were actually something more descriptive, for example, the \"right to delete\". The European Commission has now proposed to make the \"right to be forgotten\" into a law. It's a big step to turn a vague political slogan into a law. ¶ What is the \"right to be forgotten\"? There is a spectrum of views. On one end of the spectrum, the \"right to be forgotten\" is simply viewed as a re-branding of long-standing data protection principles, in particular: the rights to access and rectify one's own personal data, the right to oppose processing of one's personal data in the absence of legitimate purposes, the principle of data minimization. On this end of the spectrum, people think that the \"right to be forgotten\" is nothing new; at most, it is simply an attempt to apply long-standing data protection principles to the new worlds of the Internet and modern technologies. I'm firmly in this school of thought. ¶ On the other end of the spectrum, the \"right to be forgotten\" is viewed more sweepingly as a new right to delete information about oneself, even if published by a third-party, even if the publication was legitimate and the content was true. This school of thought believes that people should have the right to force third-parties to delete content about them (photos, blogs, anything) that violates their sense of privacy, which in practice usually means their online reputations.

The data covers more than three-quarters of all requests to date. ¶ Previously, more emphasis has been placed on selective information concerning the more sensational examples of so-called right to be forgotten requests released by Google and reported by some of the media, which have largely ignored the majority of requests made by citizens concerned with protecting their personal privacy. ¶ These include a woman whose name appeared in prominent news articles after her husband died, another seeking removal of her address, and an individual who contracted HIV a decade ago.

As suggested at the start of this chapter, what is being suggested is not about rewriting history or about censorship: it is about placing more effective, better controlled and realisable limitations on the government or commercial holding of more data than is needed. To describe it as a ‘right to be forgotten’ could be seen as misleading or disingenuous; it is not about forgetting, but about control and autonomy. . . . A right to be forgotten can be seen as a rejection of society and something ultimately undemocratic, whereas a right to delete, properly set out and balanced with other rights, can be something precisely the opposite and act as a support and protection for individuals in their interaction with society.

Is the risk a result of activities within the core business or outside of it? If outside, and the level of risk is deemed relatively high, then consideration should be given to ceasing or avoiding to undertake those activities. If the activities are part of the core business, then consider if there is another way of doing things that will avoid or minimize the risk or loss. ¶ Acceptance Without risk there is no reward. If the risk is low enough, then accept it as a cost of doing business–acknowledging that little to no action is being taken to mitigate that risk. An entity could establish a contingency fund or build a contingency plan to minimize any loss not previously anticipated from these risks. ¶ Transference Risk transference is the process of transferring any losses incurred to a third party, such as through the use of insurance policies. Another method of transferring risk is to outsource activities to a third party. If there are activities that are not core to the business, then it might make more sense to transfer these activities to a third party to whose core business they do belong, especially if internal resources are limited. Many back-office functions, such as payroll and purchasing, are outsourced to service providers that specialize in these areas. ¶ Control A control is a procedure used to either prevent a risk from occurring or detect a risk after it has occurred. If the risk is worth taking and is part of an organization's core operating activities, then controls can be used to mitigate and manage the risk. (†744)"

By contrast, \"unsafe harbors\" describe conduct that will be deemed to violate the rule. ¶ Safe harbors have been promoted by legal writers as reducing the uncertainty created by simply employing a vague standard (such as \"recklessness\"). On the other hand, this type of rule formulation also avoids the problem of creating a precise rule that leaves a judge with no available discretion to allow for \"hard cases.\" In theory, the safe harbor formulation can combine the virtues of vague standards and precise rules, allowing legislatures to prescribe with certainty the advance outcome for specific foreseeable cases, and to leave to judges to decide the cases that remain.

          "text": "Trusted Computing Group 2010 (†585 p.3-4) : ...We have selected six specific areas of the cloud computing environment where equipment and software implementing TCG specifications can provide substantial security improvements [Hanna and Molina, 2010]. 1 - Securing data at rest: Cryptographic encryption is certainly the best practice and in many U.S. states and countries worldwide, it’s the law for securing data at rest at the cloud provider. Fortunately, hard drive manufacturers are now shipping self-encrypting drives that implement the TCG’s Trusted Storage standards. Self-encrypting drives build encryption hardware into the drive, providing automated encryption with minimal cost or performance impact. Software encryption can also be used, but it is slower and less secure since the encryption key can be copied off the machine without detection. 2 - Securing data in transit: Encryption techniques should also be used for data in transit. In addition, authentication and integrity protection ensure that data only goes where the customer wants it to go and is not modified in transit. Well-established protocols such as SSL/TLS should be used here. The tricky part is strong authentication, as described next. 3 - Authentication: User authentication is often the primary basis for access control, keeping the bad guys out while allowing authorized users in with a minimum of fuss. In the cloud environment, authentication and access control are more important than ever since the cloud and all of its data are accessible to anyone over the Internet. The TPM can easily provide stronger authentication than username and passwords. TCG’s IF-MAP standard allows for real-time communication between the cloud provider and the customer about authorized users and other security issues. When a user is fired or reassigned, the customer’s identity management system can notify the cloud provider in real-time so that the user’s cloud access can be modified or revoked within seconds. If the fired user is logged into the cloud, they can be immediately disconnected. Trusted Computing enables authentication of client PCs and other devices, which also is critical to ensuring security in cloud computing. 4 - Separation between customers: One of the more obvious cloud concerns is separation between a cloud provider’s users (who may be competing companies or even hackers) to avoid inadvertent or intentional access to sensitive information. Typically a cloud provider would use virtual machines (VMs) and a hypervisor to separate customers. TCG technologies can provide significant security improvements for VM and virtual network separation. In addition, the TPM can provide hardware-based verification of hypervisor and VM integrity. The TNC architecture and standards can provide strong network separation and security. 5 - Cloud legal and regulatory issues: To verify that a cloud provider has strong policies and practices that address legal and regulatory issues, each customer must have its legal and regulatory experts inspect cloud provider policies and practices to ensure their adequacy. The issues to be considered include data security and export, compliance, auditing, data retention and destruction, and legal discovery. In the areas of data retention and deletion, Trusted Storage and TPM access techniques can play a key role in limiting access to data. 6 - Incident response: As part of expecting the unexpected, customers need to plan for the possibility of cloud provider security breaches or user misbehavior. An automated response or at least automated notification is the best solution. TCG’s IF-MAP (Metadata Access Protocol) specification enables the integration of different security systems and provides real-time notification of incidents and of user misbehavior. (†1156)"

It's an allocation-of-liability issue that needs to be addressed.\" Luckily, larger companies are beginning to negotiate away this liability with vendors. The city of Los Angeles approached Microsoft and Google to determine which company would satisfy its cloud computing requirements. And Los Angeles was able to negotiate service that included accessibility, liability, privacy, service level agreements that guarantee the availability of data, and responsibility for damages or losses of the city's data. That victory does not mean companies are now covered. Vendors have yet to remove the clause from their contracts. \"[The contract with the clause intact] is the starring point the vendors are using,\" said Kalinich. \"But the large entities are not accepting that. They're renegotiating the contracts to allocate the liability appropriately between the client and vendor.\" (†1543)"

This can be a legally binding formal or an informal \"contract\" (for example, internal department relationships). Contracts between the service provider and other third parties are often (incorrectly) called SLAs – because the level of service has been set by the (principal) customer, there can be no \"agreement\" between third parties; these agreements are simply \"contracts.\" Operational-level agreements or OLAs, however, may be used by internal groups to support SLAs. SLAs commonly include segments to address: a definition of services, performance measurement, problem management, customer duties, warranties, disaster recovery, termination of agreement.[1] In order to ensure that SLAs are consistently met, these agreements are often designed with specific lines of demarcation and the parties involved are required to meet regularly to create an open forum for communication. Contract enforcement (rewards and penalties) should be rigidly enforced, but most SLAs also leave room for annual revisitation so that it is possible to make changes based on new information.[2] (†468)"

These, in turn, create two separate sets of risks for corporations. The former creates risks associated with IT (data security and privacy, systems reliability, disaster recovery), while the latter creates risks on the financial side of things. Over the next couple of posts, we will explore in more detail these two sides of shadow IT, and how companies can deal with them effectively. (†2741)"

Our shared norms, values and understandings are less concrete than our social networks. Sociologists sometimes speak of norms as society’s unspoken and largely unquestioned rules. Norms and understandings may not become apparent until they’re broken. If adults attack a child, for example, they breach the norms that protect children from harm. Values may be more open to question; indeed societies often debate whether their values are changing.

SaaS providers generally price applications using a subscription fee. ¶In the SaaS model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud and cloud users access the software from cloud clients. Cloud users do not manage the cloud infrastructure and platform where the application runs. This eliminates the need to install and run the application on the cloud user's own computers, which simplifies maintenance and support. Cloud applications are different from other applications in their scalability–which can be achieved by cloning tasks onto multiple virtual machines at run-time to meet changing work demand. Load balancers distribute the work over the set of virtual machines. This process is transparent to the cloud user, who sees only a single access point. To accommodate a large number of cloud users, cloud applications can be multitenant, that is, any machine serves more than one cloud user organization. (†569)"

Storage as a service can be implemented as a business model in which a large service provider rents space in their storage infrastructure on a subscription basis. The economy of scale in the service provider's infrastructure theoretically allows them to provide storage much more cost effectively than most individuals or corporations can provide their own storage, when total cost of ownership is considered. Storage as a Service is often used to solve offsite backup challenges. Critics of storage as a service point to the large amount of network bandwidth required to conduct their storage utilizing an internet-based service. (†860)"

The Preservation Director then enters into a Preservation Service Contract with a Preservation Service Provider who provides the technological resources necessary for preservation and carries out preservation activities as directed by the Preservation Director and, presumably as specified in the Preservation Service Contract. However, an Initial Source could retain authority over the materials it wants preserved and thus also act as Preservation Director. Also, a Preservation Director could provide some preservation services in house and only contract with a Preservation Service Provider for a limited set of preservation activities. Alternatively, the Preservation Director might rely on Preservation Service Providers for all preservation services, but rely on one provider for basic ongoing services, such as processing of Submissions and storage of Preservation Targets, while awarding other contracts for specialized services, such as format conversion. ¶·Submitters and Access Clients have secondary roles in that their rights and responsibilities could be specified in Preservation Agreements or contracts without their involvement. For example, when the Initial Source is a government agency, its Preservation Service Agreement with the government archives might provide for several operating units to transmit Submissions of specified series of records for preservation. Each of these units would be a Submitter. Similarly, the Preservation Director’s contract with a Preservation Service Provider might designate classes of Access Clients who may request and receive copies of Preservation Targets, and it may limit their rights by defining access restrictions for privacy, proprietary or other reasons.

This means ensuring that the application performs as well for users in, say, London as it does for those in Cincinnati. ... Worldwide optimization can be accomplished either by situating servers globally or by relying on a Web application acceleration service, also called a content delivery network, such as that of Akamai Technologies Inc. These systems work across the Internet to improve performance, scalability and cost efficiency for users. Of course, situating servers globally can raise thorny geopolitical issues, Willis points out. Although it would be great to be able to load-balance application servers on demand in the Pacific Rim, Russia, China or Australia, the industry \"isn't even close to that yet,\" he says. \"We haven't even started that whole geopolitical discussion.\" In fact, Cohen points out, some users outside of the U.S. are wary of hosting data on servers in this country. They cite the USA Patriot Act, which increases the ability of law enforcement agencies to search telephone, e-mail communications, medical and financial records and eases restrictions on foreign-intelligence-gathering within the U.S. The Canadian government, for instance, prohibits the export of certain personal data to the U.S. \"It's hazy and not well defined,\" Cohen says of the act. \"People wonder, 'Can they just go in and take [the data] at a moment's notice, with no notification beforehand?'

The technological advantages to this approach include significant levels of fault tolerance and disaster protection, a more responsive user experience regardless of location, and the ‘illusion’ of limitless scale provided by these services. However, every country in which the services are consumed, or in which the physical datacenters reside, has its own set of local policies and regulations bearing directly on electronic service provision and data protection. Legal issues such as information privacy, security, and legal jurisdiction are highly nation specific. In the US, for example, the Patriot Act allows the US government to demand disclosure of any data stored in any datacenter, anywhere in the world if that system is operated by a US-based company, broadly defined. That single law places US-based Cloud service providers such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others at a great disadvantage when competing for business in foreign markets.

Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text (usually parsing, along with the addition of some derived linguistic features and the removal of others, and subsequent insertion into a database), deriving patterns within the structured data, and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output. 'High quality' in text mining usually refers to some combination of relevance, novelty, and interestingness. Typical text mining tasks include text categorization, text clustering, concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, sentiment analysis, document summarization, and entity relation modeling (i.e., learning relations between named entities). ¶ Text analysis involves information retrieval, lexical analysis to study word frequency distributions, pattern recognition, tagging/annotation, information extraction, data mining techniques including link and association analysis, visualization, and predictive analytics.

The information is implicit in the input data: it is hidden, unknown, and could hardly be extracted without recourse to automatic techniques of data mining. With text mining, however, the information to be extracted is clearly and explicitly stated in the text. It’s not hidden at all–most authors go to great pains to make sure that they express themselves clearly and unambiguously–and, from a human point of view, the only sense in which it is “previously unknown” is that human resource restrictions make it infeasible for people to read the text themselves. The problem, of course, is that the information is not couched in a manner that is amenable to automatic processing.

Transparency, he said, allows us to see how a resource was formed. It prospers in a linked medium such as the Internet because links let us see the connections between a resource and the ideas and values that informed it, and this in turn gives grounds for trust; it gives us reasons to have confidence in Internet resources in the way that claims about objectivity once did for paper materials. ‘What we used to believe because we thought [an] author was objective’, Weinberger affirmed, ‘we now believe because we can see . . . the sources that brought her to that position’.

Some theorists distinguish between trust and confidence, reserving trust for agents with intentions and confidence for things and processes. ‘I do not trust the sun to rise each day, at least not in any meaningful sense beyond merely having great confidence that it will do so,’ observes Russell Hardin; who is also careful to distinguish between trust and trustworthiness, the latter being what is indicated by qualities and attributes.

He or she earns trust within a critical mass of employees within an agency – or not. Trust is precious capital and the IG the sole accountable officer in handling the capital. The capital of trust lies in the hands of the official who holds an IG function alone. It is affected by far more than press coverage (which can help or hinder its accumulation) or issued reports. This applies to all Inspectors General, regardless of method of appointment. ¶ Trust depends on a delicate mix of elements. The opinions of outsiders (on the Hill, in the press) are irrelevant to the process of building or destroying employee trust. They are not dependents in the process. ¶ Trust cannot be built or rebuilt by compulsion or outside reporting or by the Hill. This part of the job every IG must (or should – it cannot be required despite being a critical element) face on his or her own from the time he or she first assumes a position in an agency or department.

Organizations require that appropriate chains of trust be established with external service providers when dealing with the many issues associated with information system security. Organizations establish and retain a level of trust that participating service providers in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provide adequate protection for the services rendered to organizations. The chain of trust can be complicated due to the number of entities participating in the consumer-provider relationship and the types of relationships between the parties. External service providers may also outsource selected services to other external entities, making the chain of trust more difficult and complicated to manage. Depending on the nature of the services, organizations may find it impossible to place significant trust in external providers. This situation is due not to any inherent untrustworthiness on the part of providers, but to the intrinsic level of risk in the services. Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be established in the external services and/or providers, organizations can: (i) mitigate the risk by employing compensating controls; (ii) accept the risk within the level of organizational risk tolerance; (iii) transfer risk by obtaining insurance to cover potential losses; or (iv) avoid risk by choosing not to obtain the services from certain providers (resulting in performance of missions/business operations with reduced levels of functionality or possibly no functionality at all). For example, in the case of cloud-based information systems and/or services, organizations might require as a compensating control, that all information stored in the cloud be encrypted for added security of the information. Alternatively, organizations may require encrypting some of the information stored in the cloud (depending on the criticality or sensitivity of such information)—accepting additional risk but limiting the risk of not storing all information in an unencrypted form.

Public data does not necessarily translate into accurate and reliable data, especially when multiple sources are combined. For example, a man who died in 1979 is listed by a website that advertises itself as a “People Search Engine”. The website used consolidated public data to determine that the man is 92 years old and living in Florida, although he never lived there and his wife had remarried and later was widowed again. He also gained an incorrect middle initial with his move, which just happens to be the initial of his wife. Had that website managed its master data effectively and cross-referenced it with the Social Security Death Index (SSDI), it would have concluded that he died in 1979. Chapter 1. Introducing big data 9 The same holds true for social data, whether from social media or product or service reviews. Extracting sentiment through text analytics is a useful activity in terms of discerning reactions to, for example, products and events. In doing so, analysts must recognize there is a good likelihood that some or all of the postings or reviews could be false, either paid for by companies or individuals seeking to improve their ratings, or to disparage competitors. Gartner Group estimates that by 2014, false reviews constitute 10 - 15% of all reviews.14 Case in point: A travel website with over 200 million unique visitors per month recently removed over 100 reviews that were created by a hotel chain executive. The executive created positive reviews of his properties while creating negative reviews of his rivals. (†2704)"

Most systems have one or more vulnerabilities, but this does not mean that the systems are too flawed to use. Not every threat results in an attack, and not every attack succeeds. Success depends on the degree of vulnerability, the strength of attacks, and the effectiveness of any countermeasures in use. If the attacks needed to exploit a vulnerability are very difficult to carry out, then the vulnerability may be tolerable. If the perceived benefit to an attacker is small, then even an easily exploited vulnerability may be tolerable. However, if the attacks are well understood and easily made, and if the vulnerable system is employed by a wide range of users, then it is likely that there will be enough motivation for someone to launch an attack.
