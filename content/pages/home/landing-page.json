      "As public institutions increasingly digitize and share records online, and as more digital-born records become accessible, the risk of using AI, including exposing sensitive personal data, has grown significantly.",
      "Clio-X addresses these risks by allowing archives to manage consent and usage rights for their data while ensuring that computations are performed where the data is stored. This means that the raw data is never moved or exposed; only the results or insights from the computations are shared.",
